# Daniel Nagy 😎

**`Young adult at the start of my career (Software developer / Carp angler / Gym enthusiast)`**

I currently work as a Java Developer at Ericsson Hungary.

I am a young aspiring software engineer and wanna be content creator, currently working as a System Administrator working in cloud technologies.
I enjoy spending time learning and creating new things, so I can accomplish my goals.
My coding projects are my own attempts at getting better and some day landing a job as a Java or Web developer.
I love challenging myself and I am a big believer in stepping out of our confort zones to improve and get better day by day.

Outside of Computer Science I enjoy spending time with my friends, exploring the great outdoors, hiking, going on road trips and carp fishing
as these things allow me to relax and enjoy the moment and appreciate the little things in life.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Daniel's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about programming. My biggest motivation was to learn IOS development and become a software engineer at Apple, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to master Java. This is the current stage as before graduation I started working as a System Administrator so I had to focus on learning all I could about the cloud. I consider this an advantage and I never stopped coding. I constantly try to improve and land my forst Software Engineering job.
